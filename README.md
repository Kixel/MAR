# Multi-Attack-Resolver
This is a small Web-App designed to make combat in Pathfinder 1E a little easier. It allows setup of your characters attack pattern and can roll these dice automatically. This is mainly for characters with lots of attacks per round (and thus a lot of tedium).
A small instance hosted on github can be found here: https://kixel.github.io/MAR/
